# Learning Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository contains solutions to simple Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems implemented in JavaScript, aiming to be beginner-friendly.

## Problems

Here's a list of the solved problems. Click on the problem name to navigate to its dedicated folder:

- [Count Odd and Even](./count-odd-even)
- [Find Average](./find-average)
- [Digit to Word](./digit-to-words)
- [Divisible by 6](./divisible-by-6)
- [Check Palindrome](./check-palindrome)
- [Count vowels](./count-vowels)
- [Perfect Square](./perfect-square)
- [Find max in matrix](./max-in-matrix)
- [Sum Of Digits](./sum-digits)
- [Two sums](./two-sums)
- [Palindrome Number](./Palindrome-Number)
- [Roman To Integer](./roman-to-integer)
- [Difference of Squares](./difference-squares)
- [FizzBuzz](./fizz-buzz)

## How to Explore

Each problem has its own dedicated folder within this repository. Inside each folder, you will typically find:

* **JavaScript solution file(s):** The implementation of the algorithm or data structure problem.
* **Potentially a `README.md`:** A file explaining the problem, the approach taken, and how to run the solution.

To explore a specific problem, simply click on the link in the "Problems" section above, which will take you to the respective folder in the repository.
