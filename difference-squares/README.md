## Difference between sum of the squares of first n natural numbers and square of sum

**Given an integer n, find the absolute difference between sum of the squares of first n natural numbers and square of sum of first n natural numbers.**

Examples : 
```
Input : n = 3
Output : 22
Sum of first three numbers is 3 + 2 + 1 = 6
Square of the sum =  36
Sum of squares of first three is 9 + 4 + 1 = 14
Absolute difference = 36 - 14 = 22

Input : n = 10
Output : 2640
```

- Time Complexity: O(n)
- Auxiliary Space: O(1)
