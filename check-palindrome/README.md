## Given an integer n, find whether the number is Palindrome or not. A number is a Palindrome if it remains the same when its digits are reversed.

Examples:
```
    Input: n = 12321
    Output: Yes
    Explanation: 12321 is a Palindrome number because after reversing its digits, the number becomes 12321 which is the same as the original number.

    Input: n = 1234
    Output: No
    Explanation: 1234 is not a Palindrome number because after reversing its digits, the number becomes 4321 which is different from the original number.
