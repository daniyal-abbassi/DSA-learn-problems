## Given an array, the task is to find average of that array. Average is the sum of array elements divided by the number of elements.

Examples : 
```
Input : arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
Output : 3
Sum of the elements is 1+2+3+4+5 = 15 
and total number of elements is 5.
So average is 15/5 = 3

Input : arr[] = {5, 3, 6, 7, 5, 3}
Output : 4.83333
Sum of the elements is 5+3+6+7+5+3 = 29
and total number of elements is 6.
So average is 29/6 = 4.83333.
```
